[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Description[/b][/size][/font]
Fixed and IMPROVED version of the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1635]Longer Ship Outpost and Item Names[/url], which is currently abandoned. The mod increases the maximum name length allowed for Outposts, Ships and Items.
In the original mod, renaming of Items never worked because items have a second length check, that allows only 26 characters.  
I've found the second check, made the mod update resistant, it supports all versions since release and I even made an ASI Loader version, for people who are playing the GamePass version of the game.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Uninstall[/b][/size][/font]
To uninstall the mod/plugin manually, delete the [b]SF-LongerNames.dll[/b] from your [i](game root)\Data\SFSE\plugins\[/i] directory.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Configuration[/b][/size][/font]
[i]Since v2.0.0, the mod uses a toml file, before it was an ini.[/i]
You can change the maximum allowed names length in the [b]SF-LongerNames.toml[/b].
1. You will find the [b]SF-LongerNames.toml[/b] in the installation directory of the mod. It should be in [i](game root)[/i][i]\Data\SFSE\plugins\[/i] directory for the SFSE version.
    [size=2]If the file doesn't exist, start the game once, until the main menu, then the file should appear But close the game again, before doing any changes.[/size]
2. Open the SF-LongerNames.toml with any Text Editor and change the value of [b]maxNameLength[/b].
The value must be between 5 and 255.
3. Save the file and start the game again.

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Compatibility[/b][/size][/font]
Obviously the mod is not compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1635]Longer Ship Outpost and Item Names[/url]. Which is currently outdated anyway, but if you're playing on the older version of the game or it will be fixed in the future, you shouldn't try to use both mods at the same time.
